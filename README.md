## üì¶ Creational Patterns
These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

| Pattern           | Description                                                                 | Use Case                                                                                          | When to Use                                                                                      |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **AbstractFactory** | Creates families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes | UI Toolkits, game character kits                                                                  | When your code needs to work with various families of related products                          |
| **Builder**         | Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation       | Creating documents, meal combos, complex DTOs                                                     | When an object has many optional fields or configuration steps                                   |
| **Factory Method**  | Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter it     | Logging frameworks, notification senders                                                          | When you need to delegate instantiation to subclasses                                            |
| **Prototype**       | Creates objects by cloning existing ones                                    | Graphic editors, document templates                                                               | When object creation is costly and you want to clone existing instances                          |
| **Singleton**       | Ensures a class has only one instance and provides global access to it       | Configuration managers, caches, loggers                                                           | When exactly one instance of a class is required and globally accessible                         |

## üîå Structural Patterns
These patterns deal with object composition and typically help ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system doesn't need to do the same.

| Pattern           | Description                                                                 | Use Case                                                                                          | When to Use                                                                                      |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| **Bridge**          | Separates abstraction from implementation                                  | UI rendering, cross-platform drivers                                                              | When you want to vary abstraction and implementation independently                               |
| **Composite**       | Treats individual objects and groups uniformly                             | File system structures, GUIs                                                                      | When clients should treat individual objects and compositions the same                           |
| **Decorator**       | Adds new behavior to objects dynamically                                   | GUI components, logging wrappers                                                                  | When you need to add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically                          |
| **Facade**          | Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem                    | Simplified API for subsystems like JDBC, EmailService                                             | When you want to provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem               |
| **Flyweight**       | Reduces memory usage by sharing common parts of object state               | Text editors, game particle systems                                                               | When many objects share common data and memory efficiency is critical                           |
| **Proxy**           | Provides a placeholder or surrogate for another object                     | Lazy loading, access control, remote proxy                                                        | When you need to control access to another object or add functionality without changing it       |

## üîÅ Behavioral Patterns
These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

| Pattern                | Description                                                                   | Use Case                                                                                          | When to Use                                                                                      |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| **Command**            | Encapsulates a request as an object                                          | Undo mechanisms, macro recording                                                                  | When you need parameterize requests, delay execution, or support undo                            |
| **Iterator**           | Provides a way to access elements sequentially                               | Collections traversal                                                                             | When you want to access elements without exposing underlying representation                      |
| **Mediator**           | Reduces communication between objects by centralizing it                    | Chat rooms, UI widget interaction                                                                 | When objects communicate in complex ways and you want to avoid tight coupling                    |
| **Memento**            | Captures and restores an object's internal state                            | Undo/redo functionality, game save states                                                         | When you need to restore an object to a previous state without violating encapsulation           |
| **Observer**           | Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects                            | Event systems, UI listeners                                                                      | When a change in one object requires changes in others, and you want to minimize coupling        |
| **State**              | Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes      | Vending machines, game characters                                                                | When an object‚Äôs behavior depends on its state                                                   |
| **Strategy**           | Defines a family of interchangeable algorithms                              | Sorting algorithms, payment processing                                                            | When you want to choose an algorithm at runtime                                                  |
| **Template Method**    | Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass                     | File parsers, game loops                                                                          | When the core algorithm stays the same but individual steps vary                                 |
| **Visitor**            | Lets you define new operations without changing object structure            | AST processing, document rendering                                                               | When you need to perform operations across a set of heterogeneous objects without modifying them |

## üß≠ Usage Guidelines

- Each pattern is located in its own package with well-named Java classes.
- Each example contains:
  - Interfaces/abstract classes
  - Concrete implementations
  - A main/demo class to run and observe behavior
- JavaDoc comments explain the roles of each class.
